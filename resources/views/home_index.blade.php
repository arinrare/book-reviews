            <p>My name is Michael Baggott, and am an avid fan of Science Fiction and Fantasy novels. These are my favourite genres, though i will sometimes read other genres and the reviews will not necessarily be limited to these.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>This site contains spoiler free reviews, so there is no in depth discussion about plot here. One of my pet hates is reading reviews that spoil a story before you have a chance to read it and draw your own conclusion.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Enjoy the reviews!</p>
